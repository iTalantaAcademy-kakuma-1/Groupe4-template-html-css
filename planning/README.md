# Project starter

Starter materials for the Planning and Collaborating deliverable, you can copy-paste these files into your repository's /planning folder:

- [./surpersonas.md](../package.jsonttps://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/workflows/blob/master/project-starter/user-personas.md):A description of your website's users and their motivations.
- [./backlog.md](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/workflows/blob/master/project-starter/backlog.md):The prioritized list of user stories in your project.
- [./design.md & ./wireframe.svg](): A wireframe and some explanation of the site's design.
- [./development-strategy.md](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/workflows/blob/master/project-starter/development-strategy.md):A high-level plan for the steps you will use while building the site, and what code you might need for each step. This is a living document! You don't need to make a perfect plan from the beginning, and your team should adjust the strategy during development if something isn't working.
  
This file will help you figure out how to convert your development-strategy.md into issues, labels and milestones:
- [./issues.md](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/workflows/blob/master/project-starter/issues.md):A suggestion for issues you can put on your project board.

And these files contain the finished code & assets your group will be reconstructing one Pull Request at a time. You should not copy-paste these files directly into the repository. Instead each group member will contribute a small part of the code one PR at a time until the entire site has been reassembled on the main branch:


- [./index.html](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/workflows/blob/master/project-starter/index.html)
- [./style.css](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/workflows/blob/master/project-starter/styles.css)
- [./happy-tree.jpg](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/workflows/blob/master/project-starter/happy-tree.jpg)


You don't like something about the web page? No problem! You're encouraged to make any changes to the plan or code as long as your whole team agrees.
